===========

Tizen client for qrbus.ru service

The product consists of two subprojects:
 * QRBusDemo is a webapp frontend for qrbus.ru service (though heavily improved during the hackathon);
 * QRDemo is a modified sample for QR code recognition to serve as fast scanner to transfer data to frontend.

Feel free to request any additional documentation or features.
